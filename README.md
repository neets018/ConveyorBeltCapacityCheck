Conveyor Belt Capacity Check:

How It Works:
The program frist prompts the user to enter the amount of motors are in use for the packages that will pass over (only takes whole numbers). It stores the value and then prompts the user to enter the total weight of the packages.
Each motor can carry a max of 5.6kg.
The program calculates the total carrying capacity of the motors that are in use by multiplying the amount of motors entered ealier and the carrying capacity of the motors.
It compares the total mass of the packages to the total carrying capacity and outputs whether the motors can carry the packages or not.
